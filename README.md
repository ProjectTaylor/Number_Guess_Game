# Number_Guess_Game
It's always fun to take a trip down memory lane so I decided to keep. This was my first program written in 2017. It creates a random integer and the user has to guess what it is.
It counts how many guesses the user makes.
End of program allows the user to play again.
One nifty feature when incorrect strings or floats are entered.
